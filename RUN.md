Commands
1. `git clone https://github.com/gracedai1/CS128H-Rust-finalproject` -> clone repository

2. `cargo run` in terminal -> builds the project

3. Do these steps for each new user you want to create:

    - open up a new terminal window and run `nc localhost 5678`
    - go back to the main terminal and enter the name for the user, where prompted


Each new `nc` terminal window represents a different client/user. You can drag each terminal window out so that you can see them on the page side-by-side, so you can see all the chats being exchanged in real time, as you send them.
